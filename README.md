## 🧠 00_theory/

Core networking concepts explained simply:
- `osi-model.md` – The 7-layer OSI model
- `tcp-ip-model.md` – The 4-layer TCP/IP model
- `ip-addressing-subnetting.md` – Binary math, subnetting, CIDR
- `protocols-overview.md` – Common protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.
- `routing-basics.md` – Static vs dynamic routing explained
- `vlans-trunking.md` – VLANs, trunk ports, and inter-VLAN routing
- `acls.md` – Access Control Lists (standard, extended)
- `nat-pat.md` – NAT types and Port Address Translation
- `network-security-basics.md` – Firewalls, IDS/IPS, secure design

---

## 🧰 01_tools/

Guides to using essential networking tools:
- `wireshark-basics.md` – Capturing and analyzing packets
- `nmap-intro.md` – Scanning and discovering hosts/services
- `packet-sniffing.md` – Packet capture concepts and techniques

---

## 🔬 02_packet_tracer_labs/

Cisco Packet Tracer simulations with `.pkt` files and instructions:
- `lab1_basic-lan-setup.pkt` – Simple LAN with 3 PCs and 2 switches
- `lab2_vlan-routing.pkt` – VLAN config and inter-VLAN routing
- `lab3_static-routing.pkt` – Configuring static routes between routers
- `lab4_acl-implementation.pkt` – ACL filtering based on conditions
- `lab5_nat-dhcp-config.pkt` – NAT + DHCP setup
- `lab6_redundant-network.pkt` – Redundancy with EtherChannel or HSRP

> 📎 These labs include `.pkt` files and accompanying `README.md` instructions.

---

## 🐍 03_scripts/

Python scripts for networking automation, scanning, and packet analysis:
- `ping_sweep.py` – Discover live hosts in a subnet
- `sniff_packets.py` – Live packet capture with Scapy
- (more to be added: port scanner, ARP poisoning, config backup, etc.)

> Many of these scripts use libraries like `scapy`, `nmap`, or `netmiko`.

## 🎯 Goals

- Help students and self-learners understand networking visually and practically
- Provide real lab setups to practice exam topics (e.g., CCNA)
- Encourage Python-based automation and network scripting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/networking-labs.git
   cd networking-labs
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies (for `03_scripts/`)
   ```bash
   pip install scapy nmap netmiko
   ```

3. Open `.pkt` files using Cisco Packet Tracer for hands-on practice.
