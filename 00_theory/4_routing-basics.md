# Routing Basics

**Routing** is the process of selecting paths in a network to send data packets between devices.

## 📦 Types of Routing

| Type       | Description                            | Example         |
|------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Static     | Manually configured routes             | Small networks  |
| Dynamic    | Auto-updated via protocols             | RIP, OSPF, EIGRP|
| Default    | Used when no specific route is known   | 0.0.0.0/0       |

## 🗺️ Key Concepts

- **Router** – A device that connects different networks
- **Routing Table** – List of known routes
- **Hop** – One segment of a route
- **Metric** – Value to determine best route

---

## 🔧 Dynamic Routing Protocols

- **RIP** – Simple, distance-vector, max 15 hops
- **OSPF** – Link-state, fast and scalable
- **EIGRP** – Cisco proprietary, hybrid protocol
- **BGP** – Used on the internet (between ISPs)

## 📌 Summary
- Routing is critical for inter-network communication
- Understand static vs dynamic
- Know how to read a routing table
