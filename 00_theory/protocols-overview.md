# Protocols Overview

Protocols are rules that govern how data is transmitted over a network. Each operates at specific layers in the OSI/TCP-IP models.

## 🌐 Common Protocols by Layer

### Application Layer (OSI Layer 7 / TCP-IP Layer 4)
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Web traffic
- **FTP/SFTP** – File transfers
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3** – Email services
- **DHCP** – IP address assignment

### Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)
- **TCP** – Reliable, connection-oriented
- **UDP** – Fast, connectionless

### Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)
- **IP** – Logical addressing
- **ICMP** – Ping and diagnostics
- **IGMP** – Multicast

### Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
- **Ethernet** – LAN communication
- **ARP** – Resolves IP to MAC

## 🔐 Security-Focused Protocols
- **HTTPS** – Encrypted HTTP (TLS)
- **SSH** – Secure remote access
- **IPSec** – Secure IP communications
- **SSL/TLS** – Encryption layer for multiple protocols

## 📌 Summary
- Protocols define how devices communicate
- Layered protocols allow modular design
- TCP vs UDP is a key concept to understand
