# TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP Model** is a simplified, practical model used in real-world networking. It maps closely to how the internet works.

##  Layers of the TCP/IP Model

| Layer        | Function                        | Protocols Examples |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Application  | User interface, data format     | HTTP, FTP, DNS     |
| Transport    | End-to-end communication        | TCP, UDP           |
| Internet     | Logical addressing, routing     | IP, ICMP           |
| Network Access | Physical addressing, media    | Ethernet, ARP      |

##  OSI vs TCP/IP Mapping

| OSI Layer                  | TCP/IP Layer        |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Application (7,6,5)        | Application         |
| Transport (4)              | Transport           |
| Network (3)                | Internet            |
| Data Link + Physical (2,1) | Network Access      |

##  Key Points
- TCP/IP is more practical than OSI
- TCP = Reliable, connection-based
- UDP = Fast, connectionless
- IP = Addressing and routing

---

##  Summary
- TCP/IP is the backbone of the Internet
- Understanding its structure is essential for network configuration and troubleshooting
